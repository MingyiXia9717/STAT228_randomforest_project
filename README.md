# STAT228_randomforest_project
Group project during STAT 228 (Multivariate Data Analysis) taught by Professor Qing Wang

Group members: May Xia and Caiqin Zhou

In our simulation study, we compared the performance of
random forest, bagging, and single decision tree models in a regression context; we also
examined how the number of bootstrap samples and the number of predictors considered at
each node would affect the performance of random forests.
